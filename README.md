In my spare time, I like to browse videos from some hot Tech Youtubers. When they are typing a piece of code, I notice that they would utilize some keyboard shortcuts or IDE shortcuts so that they could improve some coding efficiency. I am a big fan of Jetbrain, and I download many IDEs from Jetbrain like Idea, PyCharm, WebStorm, etc. Jetbrain shortcuts are amazing. For example, you can easily refactor a group of variables instead of finding them and renaming them one at a time. However, when you need to write a massive project, sometimes it's not enough. Imagine if you write a large function that contains a function that contains a function. How are you gonna find the brackets? 

I find one youtuber introducing Vim, and some related articles. I think this article is pretty interesting. It mentioned that *Vim is for* **programmers who want to raise their game**. By using Vim, you can spend less time toggling with your trackpad or mouse, and instead focus on the code. You can do some repetitive work easily, for example copying and pasting a function for 10 times. Vim can really boost up your effiency in developing apps.
